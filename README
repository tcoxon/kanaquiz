kanaquiz
--------

Crude perl flashcard quiz script for teaching hiragana and katakana by Tom
Coxon.

Uses Lingua::JA::Romaji by Jacob C. Kesinger.

Licensed under the GNU General Public License. A copy of this was distributed
with your perl interpreter.

Instructions:
-------------

To test hiragana:
    $ perl quiz.pl --kana=hira

To test katakana:
    $ perl quiz.pl --kana=kata

When the script presents a character to you, enter the corresponding romaji and
hit enter. If you get it wrong, the script will ask for it again. If you give
up, hit enter without entering anything, and the script will tell you the
romaji.

Send EOF to exit. On most unixes, this will be Ctrl-D. I believe it might be
Ctrl-Z on Windows.
